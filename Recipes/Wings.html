    <h1>Wings Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./RecipeImages/FinishedWing.png">
    <h3>Descripiton</h3>
    <p>There's no substitute for a classic Buffalo wing when it comes to snacking while watching a game or relaxing on a weekend afternoon. These wings are fried, then tossed in a buttery hot sauce and served with blue cheese dipping sauce and celery. The tangy blue cheese dressing is the perfect counterpart to the wings. If you like extra-crispy wings, fry them for an extra minute or two. And if you have an air fryer, cook the wings skin-side up to keep the skin as crispy as possible.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    
<li><p>1/3 cup of sour cream</p></li>
<li><p>1/4 cup of mayo</p></li>
<li><p>2 tablespoons of whole buttermilk</p></li>
<li><p>2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice</p></li>
<li><p>4 ounces of bleu cheese, crumbled</p></li>
<li><p>1 teaspoon of finely chopped chives</p></li>
<li><p>1/8 teaspoon of kosher salt</p></li>
<li><p>10 small wings, flat</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Prepare Bleu Cheese Dressing:</h4>
<h5>Step 1</h5>
<p>Stir together sour cream, mayonnaise, buttermilk, and lemon juice in a medium bowl; fold in blue cheese, chives and salt. Cover and chill until ready to serve. </p>
<h4>Prepare the Buffalo Wings:</h4>
<h5>Step 1</h5>
<p>Place a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Pour vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven to a depth of 2 inches; heat oil to 375°F over medium. Fry chicken drumettes and wing flats in 2 batches until golden brown and until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers at least 165°F, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to wire rack. </p>
<h5>Step 2</h5>
<p>While chicken cooks, bring hot sauce and butter to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium, whisking occasionally. Simmer, whisking occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 1 minute. Cover and set aside. </p>
<h5>Step 3</h5>
<p>Place Buffalo Wings and sauce in a large bowl; toss until wings are evenly coated. Transfer to a platter, and serve with Blue Cheese Dressing and celery sticks. </p>
